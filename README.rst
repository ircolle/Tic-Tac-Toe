Story
======

I want to see how you code a game of Tic Tac Toe, so that I can get a feel for your skills and strengths.

Acceptance criteria
=======================

* The AI should never lose
* The submission must include both server & client side code -- no CLI-only or browser-only implementations. Play to your strengths, but show us your full range of skills.
* Quality counts! A good submission that takes a while is better than a poor submission quickly.
* You should include clear instructions for how to run your application


Technical notes
------------------

* It is not a requirement that you implement your program as a Django app.
* Make sure your submission accurately reflects your development style.
* Commit early and often, with good messages.
